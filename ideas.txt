1st idea:
All your social media feeds in one place; twitter, facebook, instagram, etc. feeds, all parsed and combined to make it into a single feed.
You'll be able to to post via the webpage/app into all of your feeds or whichever ones you choose. 
Possible other features: a profile that shows information from all the different social media websites, at the end of the day the app/page could show things according to what you did all day on social media.
APIs: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
Database: Used to store users' access tokens, profile information if we go with that idea.


2nd idea:
Web application (temporarily calling it StudyBuddy) where the user would enter in their location, and the site will go through all coffee shops in a designated area (ie. 5 mile radius) and look at yelp ratings and figure out and tell the user the coffee shops’ best qualities so they can make a decision if they want to go to it or not. The user then can rate it after (to add more information to the database) and the user can have a profile that will list all of the places they’ve been to (show their favorites at the top).
