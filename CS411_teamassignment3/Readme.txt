Hey guys, be sure to install these with pip before running or it won't work.

pip install flask
pip install python-twitter

then all you have to do is run app.py in your command line (bash, terminal, etc)
> python app.py

and you'll be able to access the webapp by going to
localhost:5000
in your browser
